# publish-to-github — gated push of a public repo's main branch + release tags
# to GitHub. Replaces GitLab push mirroring so that:
#   * ONLY main and release tags reach GitHub (never internal branches such as
#     claude/* or worktree-agent-*, which push mirroring would expose), and
#   * NOTHING pushes until scripts/leak-scan.sh passes (fail closed).
#
# Intended to run in GitLab CI (see .gitlab-ci.yml `publish-github`). Requires:
#   GITHUB_REPO   — "org/name" of the target GitHub repo
#   GITHUB_TOKEN  — PAT with `repo` scope (masked + protected CI variable)
#   TAG_PREFIX    — optional; only tags matching this are published (default: v)
#
# Exit: 0 pushed (or nothing to do), 1 leak-scan blocked, 2 misconfig.

# SEPARATE publisher writes "ctxone vX" commits to the GitHub tap directly,
# leaving GitHub one commit ahead every release — so a plain fast-forward push
# was rejected non-ff on EVERY release (v0.9.21..v0.9.27), silently stranding
# brew on the old version. --force-with-lease makes GitLab deterministically win
# each release while still refusing to clobber the ref if it moved out from
# under us mid-job (guards the concurrent-CI case, unlike a bare --force).
echo ">> pushing main -> github"
# Pin the lease to GitHub's CURRENT main so we overwrite the known divergence but
# still refuse if the ref moves out from under us mid-job (safer than bare
# --force). The remote was just added and never fetched, so read its main first;
# if it has no main yet (first publish) there is nothing to lease against.
